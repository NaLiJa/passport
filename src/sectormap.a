; Passport maintains a table of codes for each sector on the disk.
; One byte per sector, arranged in increasing logical sector order
; from T00,S00 to T22,S0F. Some sectors have their own individual
; labels for convenience, but you can use math to find any specific
; sector.
; e.g.
;        LDA   #kSectorOptional
;        STA   T00S0A
; will mark T00,S0A as optional
;
;        LDA   #kSectorOptional
;        LDY   #$0A
;        STA   T00,Y
; will also mark T00,S0A as optional
;
; The sector map is reset for each disk (to #kSectorRequired for
; all sectors), then modified based on boot sector identification
; and other factors.
;
; Codes are opaque values, not bit flags.
; Some codes are grouped into ranges that are compared as integers.
; Always use labels for comparison.
