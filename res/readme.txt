----------------Passport---------------A 4am hack                   2017-03-XX---------------------------------------Passport is a cracker's tool that canremove several forms of copy protectionfrom Apple II 5.25-inch floppy disks.Minimum system requirements:- Apple //e, //c, IIgs, or ][+ with 64K- Two 5.25-inch disk drives(*)(*) fully compatible with floppy driveemulators like CFFA3000 and FloppyEMU.Some fun facts about copy protection:1. Many companies, especially smaller   ones, outsourced their protection.   I have seen byte-for-byte identical   copy protection on disks from seven   different companies!2. Even companies that wrote their own   copy protection would try to re-use   it on multiple disks to get the most   "bang for the buck."3. Not everything has been cracked!   Because there was so much piracy in   the 1980s, some people assume that   everything ever published has been   cracked, digitized, and preserved in   an emulator-friendly format. In   reality, there are hundreds of disks   that have never been cracked. Thirty   years later, these programs are   still trapped on physical media,   literally rotting away.                   ~Using Passport is simple. After runningthe program, put an original disk inslot 6, drive 1 and a blank formatteddisk in any other drive. If necessary,press "S" to cycle through your drives.Then press "C" to start the cracking.If all goes well, Passport will readyour original disk and write a copy ina standard format, then remove anyprotection checks from the copy. Thecopy will boot and run just as well asthe original disk, but it will becopyable with COPYA or any full-diskcopy program.If all does not go well, Passport willtell you where it all went wrong.In any case, Passport will NEVER writeto or alter your original disk in anyway. And neither should you! Don'treduce the number of original disks inthe world; they aren't making any moreof them.                   ~Passport targets common protectionschemes that were reused by multiplecompanies. These types of protectionwere common in educational software.- Abracadata  e.g. Design Your Own Home- Apple "Special Delivery"  e.g. Ernie's Quiz, Instant Zoo- Blue Chip  e.g. Squire, Baron, Tycoon- DesignWare  e.g. Spellicopter, Crypto Cube- Developmental Learning Materials  e.g. Curious George in Outer Space,  Alien Addition- Edu-Ware  e.g. Decimals, Algebra 2- Ellen Nelson Learning Library  e.g. Science (series), House-a-fire!- Focus Media  e.g. The Time Tunnel (series),  Travels with Za-Zoom- Gamco  e.g. Math Leap Frog, Math Football- Grolier Publishing  e.g. NoteCard Maker, EduCalc- Hartley Courseware  e.g. Chariots, Cougars, and Kings;  Tim and the Cat and the Big Red Hat- Hayden  e.g. SAT Score Improvement System- Heartsoft  e.g. Electric Chalkboard, Tommy the  Time-Telling Turtle- Houghton-Mifflin  e.g. Game Frame One, Math Masters- HRM Software  e.g. Gene Machine, Heredity Dog- Josten Learning Systems  e.g. Building Reading Skills,  Explorations in Science- The Learning Company  e.g. Bumble Games, Gertrude's Secrets- Learning Technologies  e.g. Animal Hotel, Bike Hike- McCarthy-McCormack  e.g. Vowel Corral, Library Magic- MECC  e.g. Word Munchers, Clock Works- Media Basics  e.g. Return to Reading (series)- Methods & Solutions  e.g. Fantasy Land, Behind The Wheel- Millennium Group  e.g. The Brain Game, Concentration- MindPlay  e.g. Fraction-oids, Dyno-Quest- Mindscape  e.g. The Halley Project, Paperboy- Optimum Resource  e.g. Stickybear Math, Car Builder- Pelican Software  e.g. Dino Days, Graphics Converter- Polarware  e.g. The Electric Crayon (series),  The Spy's Adventures (series)- Quest Learning Systems  e.g. Bingo Bugglebee Presents Home  Alone, Outdoor Safety- Queue  e.g. Force and Motion, Practical  Grammar- Random House  e.g. Snoopy to the Rescue, Charlie  Brown's ABCs- Reader's Digest  e.g. Key Lingo, Cogito- Scholastic  e.g. Math Shop, Microzine- Spinnaker Software  e.g. Snooper Troops, KidWriter- Springboard Software  e.g. Early Games for Young Children,  Puzzle Master, Mask Parade- Sunburst Communications  e.g. M-ss-ng L-nks, The Incredible  Laboratory- Troll Associates  e.g. Dino Dig, Make A Face- Unicorn Software  e.g. Magical Myths, Ten Little RobotsThe latest version of Passport can alsorecognize and defeat the protectionused by some game companies. In generalthere was more variation and "one-off"protection in games than in educationalsoftware, so your mileage may vary.- Activision (patcher by TRex)  e.g. Hacker, Rampage- Atari  e.g. Defender, Gremlins- Border  e.g. Arena, Early Bird- Broderbund  e.g. Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego- Data East  e.g. Ikari Warriors, Batman- Electronic Arts (patcher by qkumba)  e.g. The Bard's Tale, Skyfox- Epyx  e.g. Summer Games, Deathsword- Sierra On-Line (patcher by qkumba)  e.g. BC's Quest for Tires, Sammy  Lightfoot                   ~Passport is open source and isdistributed under the MIT license.PassportCopyright (c) 2016-7 by 4amPermission is hereby granted, free ofcharge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associateddocumentation files (the "Software"),to deal in the Software withoutrestriction, including withoutlimitation the rights to use, copy,modify, merge, publish, distribute,sublicense, and/or sell copies of theSoftware, and to permit persons to whomthe Software is furnished to do so,subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and thispermission notice shall be included inall copies or substantial portions ofthe Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS",WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITEDTO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ANDNONINFRINGEMENT.
