----------------Passport---------------A 4am hack                   2016-12-30---------------------------------------Passport is a cracker's tool that canremove several forms of copy protectionfrom Apple II 5.25-inch floppy disks.Minimum system requirements:- Apple //e, //c, IIgs, or ][+ with 64K- Two 5.25-inch disk drives(*)(*) fully compatible with floppy driveemulators like CFFA3000 and FloppyEMU.Some fun facts about copy protection:1. Many companies, especially smaller   ones, outsourced their copy   protection. I have seen byte-for   byte identical copy protection on   disks from 7 different companies!2. Even companies that wrote their own   copy protection would try to re-use   it on multiple disks to get the most   "bang for the buck."3. Not everything has been cracked!   Because there was so much piracy in   the 1980s, some people assume that   everything ever published has been   cracked and ultimately preserved in   an emulator-friendly format. In   reality, there are hundreds of disks   that have never been cracked. Thirty   years later, these programs are   still trapped on physical media,   literally rotting away.                   ~Using Passport is simple. After runningthe program, put an original disk inslot 6, drive 1 and a blank formatteddisk in any other drive. If necessary,press "S" to cycle through your drives.Then press "C" to start the cracking.If all goes well, Passport will readyour original disk and write a copy ina standard format, then remove anyprotection checks from the copy. Thecopy will boot and run just as well asthe original disk, but it will becopyable with COPYA or any full-diskcopy program.If all does not go well, Passport willtell you where it all went wrong.In any case, Passport will NEVER writeto or alter your original disk in anyway. And neither should you! Don'treduce the number of original disks inthe world; they aren't making any moreof them.                   ~Passport targets common protectionschemes that were reused by multiplecompanies. These types of protectionwere common on educational software,not blockbuster arcade games.Here is a sampling of companies whosedisks Passport may be able to crack:- Apple "Special Delivery"  e.g. Ernie's Quiz, Instant Zoo- MECC  e.g. Word Munchers, Clock Works- Sunburst Communications  e.g. M-ss-ng L-nks, The Incredible  Laboratory- The Learning Company  e.g. Bumble Games, Gertrude's Secrets- Scholastic  e.g. Math Shop, Microzine- Edu-Ware  e.g. Decimals, Algebra 2- Hartley Courseware  e.g. Chariots, Cougars, and Kings;  Tim and the Cat and the Big Red Hat- Hayden  e.g. SAT Score Improvement System  (series)- Developmental Learning Materials  e.g. Curious George in Outer Space,  Alien Addition- DesignWare  e.g. Spellicopter, Crypto Cube- Mindscape  e.g. The Halley Project, Paperboy- Focus Media  e.g. The Time Tunnel (series),  Travels with Za-Zoom- MindPlay  e.g. Fraction-oids, Dyno-Quest- Spinnaker Software (limited)  e.g. Snooper Troops (series),  KidWriter- Springboard Software (limited)  e.g. Early Games for Young Children,  Puzzle Master, Mask Parade- Reader's Digest  e.g. Key Lingo, Cogito- McCarthy-McCormack  e.g. Vowel Corral, Library Magic- Troll Associates  e.g. Dino Dig, Make A Face- Abracadata  e.g. Design Your Own Home (series)- Methods & Solutions  e.g. Fantasy Land, Behind The Wheel- Mindplay  e.g. Math Magic, Ace Detective- Quest Learning Systems  e.g. Bingo Bugglebee Presents Home  Alone, Outdoor Safety- HRM Software  e.g. Gene Machine, Heredity Dog- Pelican Software  e.g. Dino Days, Graphics Converter- Unicorn Software  e.g. Magical Myths, Ten Little  Robots- Grolier Publishing  e.g. NoteCard Maker, EduCalc- Random House  e.g. Snoopy to the Rescue, Charlie  Brown's ABCs- Josten Learning Systems  e.g. Building Reading Skills,  Explorations in Science- Heartsoft  e.g. Electric Chalkboard, Tommy the  Time-Telling Turtle- Ellen Nelson Learning Library  e.g. Science (series), House-a-fire!- Millennium Group  e.g. The Brain Game, Concentration- Media Basics  e.g. Return to Reading (series)- Polarware  e.g. The Electric Crayon (series),  The Spy's Adventures (series)- Queue  e.g. Force and Motion, Practical  Grammar- Atari  e.g. Defender, Gremlins- Epyx (limited)  e.g. Summer Games, Deathsword- Data East (limited)  e.g. Ikari Warriors, Batman- Sierra On-Line (very limited)  e.g. BC's Quest for Tires, Sammy  Lightfoot- Broderbund (very limited)  e.g. The Playroom, Where in Time Is  Carmen Sandiego                   ~Passport is open source and isdistributed under the MIT license.PassportCopyright (c) 2016 by 4amPermission is hereby granted, free ofcharge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associateddocumentation files (the "Software"),to deal in the Software withoutrestriction, including withoutlimitation the rights to use, copy,modify, merge, publish, distribute,sublicense, and/or sell copies of theSoftware, and to permit persons to whomthe Software is furnished to do so,subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and thispermission notice shall be included inall copies or substantial portions ofthe Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS",WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITEDTO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ANDNONINFRINGEMENT.
